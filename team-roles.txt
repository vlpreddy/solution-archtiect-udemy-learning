We took a detailed look at the role of Functional Analyst, and learned that Communication skills, Attention to detail, and Conflict management are key skills for this role. This is a key role with lots of interactions across the organization, but unfortunately it involves a lot of (potential) conflict, and the analyst is the first to blame if any functionality is missing from the final product. 
We also looked at the Lead Developer, who requires state-of-the-art Programming skills, great Mentoring skills, and a Values-driven personality to excel at his or her job. The great thing about the lead developer role is that it is a lead-in to become an architect, the job involves coding, and usually you can cherry-pick cool tasks to work on. But unfortunately the job is vulnerable to offshoring, requires lifelong learning, and is no fun at all if the project planning turns out to be too optimistic. 
Finally we looked at the Architect role. The architect requires a strong Functional understanding, excellent Technical Knowledge, and strong Leadership skills.
The architect is a high-value position, very visible within the organization, and with a great salary. The role offers lots of interactions with pretty much anyone in the organization, and is safe from outsourcing (for now). 
But unfortunately it's also a very difficult role. The architect is responsible for all technology, and is the first to blame if anything doesn't work as intended. It's hard to stay up to date and get the architecture exactly right. And finally, an architect might receive invalid functional specifications. This is hard to spot, and even though the analyst is to blame here, the architect will probably be held responsible.  
Alright, are you ready for a quiz? Let's test your knowledge of The Architect And The Team.
