UML Design Elements

Model - contains views
Views - Are you looking at the system form the outside(external actors - customers, users, interactors) Internal view
Diagrams -  
example 1  diagram - only describes components, which components exist, how they are calling each other and what the interface of the each components are.
example 2 diagram - call timings, implement a process which methods are getting call and the order
like this we may have 15-20

UML Models
Business System Model - Non technical way of looking at the system functionality
IT System Model - Specific to technology

UML Views
 Business System : 
    External View - Looking at the system from the outside - external actors who are communicating with it
    Internal View - looking at the functionality of the system but now from the inside of the system.
    
 IT System
    Static View -  which components are there, which layers are there, which classes are there, how they fit together(how to they connect), layer of the stack, order of the stack
    Dynamic View - How the components call each other,sequence of calls,  what kind of business process and workflows does the sytem implements, what kind of choices does the system make it goes through specific usage.
    
    Seven Diagram
         Component Diagram - Describes all the components in the system and their public interfaces
and how one component call another components
  Class Diagram - Describes which classes exist in the system, how classes are compose of all other classes, all the inheritance hierarchy works, public members of the classes.
  Sequence Diagram - Describes how one class of components calls other class of components when it makes sequence of calls(when 10 calls  - sequence of calls what kind of data exchange between the objects)
  
State Diagram - Describes all descrete states, state transmissions
Activity Diagram - Describes highlevel procedures and workflows in the system
Layer Case Diagram - Describes the areas of concern, hwo the layer call each other
Use Diagram - Very high level
