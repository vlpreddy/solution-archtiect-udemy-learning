1. The process for Designing Architecture
Create/adjust objectives
  #Identify scope of architecture
  #Estimate time to spend
  #identify audience -> depends who you talk to whether it is functional analyst(usecase diagram), executives(usecase diagram), lead developer(compomnetn, class diagram)
  #identify technical-, usage- and deployment constraints -> which technologies available, which technology vitals to company, existing technology, how many peoepls are going to use, is it going to be cloud or premisis server e.t..c
  
2. Identify key scenarios
    Key Scenarios
       Significant unknown/risk
       Significant use case
       Intersection() of quality/fnction
       Tradeoff between attributes
    Significant use cases:
       Busines critical
       High Impact 
       
3. Create Overview
  Determin Application Type - webapplication/mobile application/ run on cloud
  Identify Deployment constraints - deploy in cloud, premisis e.t.c.
  Identify architecture pattern  - which archtiectureal pattern you are going to use, layered architecture, micro services, service orient architecture, pick one of them and commit to it.
  Determine the technology - which technology which you are going to use.
  Create a Layer diagram in application overview
  
4. Identify Key Issues
 Quality attributes
    System/Runtime/Design/User - performance, security, scalability, configurability,                 managibility, modularability e.t.c
    System wide Concerns
      Authentiation & authorization
      Caching
      Communication
      Configuration Management
      Logging & exeception management
      Validation
      
      
5. Create Candidate Solution
  #create a baseline architecture - first preview 
  #create candidate architecture -  second, third... review
  #Develope architectural Spikes
  
  here is where you Create Activity, Sequence, State and Component Diagrams
  Create Class Diagram if needed
  
During above Each Cycle following are few guidelines
   Donot introduce new risk
   Mitigate more risk than baseline
   meet additional requriements
   Enable more key scenarios
   Address more key issues
   
Start communicating architecture with your developer, when you exceepd 50% coverage
