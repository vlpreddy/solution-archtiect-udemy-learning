Software Architecture Requirement
  User Requirements
  Business Requirements
  IT System Requirements
  
 What composes an architecture
   structural elements and inteface composing system
   how elements behave in collaboration
   how these elements combine and work as a full feature like tree system
   architectural style that guides this composition
   
   Also covers functionality, usability, resilience, performance, reuse, comprehensibility, economic and technology constraints, tradeoffs and aesthetic concerns.
   
   
Software architecture goals
    Document high-level structure
    donot go into implementation details
    minimize complexity
    Address all requirements
    Be compatible with all use cases and scenarios
  
  
  Tips
   Build to change instead of building to last -  create something felxibility and modularize the architecture
   Use models, but inly to analyze and reduce risk
   use visualizations to communicate and collaborate
   identify and research critical points of failure - performance, scaling, e.t.c
