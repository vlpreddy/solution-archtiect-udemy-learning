Layer Archtectural Patterns
    1. Client/Server Pattern  - Example :  Web Server
          #distinct client and server
          #sperated by network
          #communication protocol
          #many clients one server
       Pros - very secure, simple communication, centralized control, easy to manage
       Cons - Requires network, difficulst to scale out, single point of failure, hard to debug
     
     2. Layer Pattern
           - Strict areas of concnern
           - Layers can communicate with direct neighbours of above and below
        
        Pros - High Abstration, High Isolation, Structured Communication, Easy to Scale out
        Cons - Deep Call Chains, Can hide complexity, may harm performance, lowest layer must             cover all user cases.
     
     3. N-Tier Pattern 
            - Layers Deployed to servers
            - Usually 3 tiers
            - Communication between layers uses network
       Pros - High abstraction, high Isolation, Structured Communciation, Easy to scale out
       Cons - Network - point of failure, network may be slow, coarse interfaces, hard to debug
