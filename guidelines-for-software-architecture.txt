Guidelines - which are independent of architecutral design patterns
  # user consistent patterns in each layer - Don't mix different patters(MVC, MVV). in a single layer like presentation layer, single layer should have single design pattern
  # Do not duplicate functionality - if there is any functionaluty which can be used by multiple layers, don't imolment in all layers, just implement ontime and use it in all layers(Example Caching) in Systemwise concern
  Prefer composition over inhertiance - better try to use composition, agregation, encapsulation  classes instead of using inheritance heirarchy
  Establish a code convention - naming convention, defining variables
